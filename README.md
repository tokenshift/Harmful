Harmful
=======

.NET library for working with UTF-16 character data.

The .NET framework already includes the functionality needed to deal with UTF-16 data and convert to-from other encodings, but very little of this is implemented in a platform-independent manner due to specific platforms (looking at you, Silverlight) lacking many of the required methods. *Harmful* is a collection of helper methods to replace this functionality, packaged as a portable class library.

The name comes from this Stack Exchange (originally Stack Overflow) question: http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/102205/should-utf-16-be-considered-harmful
